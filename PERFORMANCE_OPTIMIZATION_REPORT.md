## 🔧 Configuration Recommendations

### Production Redis Configuration
```typescript
{
  minConnections: 10,
  maxConnections: 50,
  enableAutoPipelining: true,
  commandTimeout: 5000,
  reconnectStrategy: exponentialBackoff
}
```

### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Required indexes (already included in materialized views)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_patient_identifier ON patient(identifier);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_observation_patient_date ON observation(patient_id, effective_date_time DESC);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_medication_request_patient_status ON medication_request(patient_id, status);
```

### Frontend Performance Budgets
- First Contentful Paint: <1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint: <2.5s
