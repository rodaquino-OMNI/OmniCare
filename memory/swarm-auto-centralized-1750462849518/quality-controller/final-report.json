  "conclusion": "The OmniCare platform is currently in a critical state with multiple compilation failures and test failures. Immediate intervention is required from specialized agents to resolve TypeScript errors, implement missing methods, and repair the test suite. The platform is NOT ready for production deployment and requires 8-10 hours of focused remediation work."
