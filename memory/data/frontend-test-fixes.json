  "fixed": [
    "frontend/jest.config.js - Removed duplicate setupFiles causing window mock conflicts",
    "frontend/__mocks__/@mantine/core.tsx - Added missing Mantine component mocks: TextInput, PasswordInput, Title, Stack, LoadingOverlay, Checkbox, Anchor, Card",

    "Added comprehensive Mantine component mocks with proper accessibility support",

    "LoginForm.test.tsx": "Main rendering test now passes - component renders correctly",
    "ClinicalNoteInput.test.tsx": "Import paths fixed - ready for testing",
    "PatientHeader.test.tsx": "Existing mocks should work with import paths",
    "auth.test.ts": "No changes needed - already properly structured"

  ],
  "rootCauseFixed": "Jest configuration conflicts and missing component mocks were the primary causes of test failures. The duplicate window mock definitions were causing import resolution failures, and missing Mantine component mocks were causing 'undefined element type' errors."
