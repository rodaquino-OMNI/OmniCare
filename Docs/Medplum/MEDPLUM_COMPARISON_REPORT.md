# OmniCare vs Medplum: Comprehensive Architecture Comparison

## Executive Summary

This report provides a detailed comparison between OmniCare's current architecture and Medplum's healthcare platform patterns, identifying key differences, adoptable patterns, and improvement opportunities that could significantly enhance OmniCare's capabilities.

### Key Findings

1. **Architecture Philosophy**: Medplum uses a monorepo, FHIR-first approach with serverless automation, while OmniCare employs a multi-project structure with strong offline capabilities
2. **Automation Gap**: Medplum's bot system provides flexible event-driven automation that OmniCare currently handles through manual task orchestration
3. **Code Organization**: Medplum's shared packages approach could reduce OmniCare's development time by 30-40%
4. **Compliance & Standards**: Medplum's native FHIR implementation and terminology services provide better standards compliance

## Adoptable Patterns & Recommendations

### Immediate Wins (2-4 weeks each)

#### 1. Bot System Architecture
```typescript
// Current OmniCare approach
async createMedicationOrderWorkflow(medicationRequestId: string) {
  // Manual task creation and orchestration
  const reviewTask = await this.createTask({...});
  const dispensingTask = await this.createTask({...});
  // Complex dependency management
}

// Proposed Medplum-style bot approach
export async function medicationOrderBot(event: FHIREvent) {
  // Automatic trigger on MedicationRequest creation
  if (event.resource.resourceType === 'MedicationRequest') {
    await createReviewTask(event.resource);
    await notifyPharmacy(event.resource);
    // Event-driven, loosely coupled
  }
}
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Design event-driven architecture
2. Create bot execution engine
3. Implement FHIR subscription handler
4. Migrate 2-3 workflows as proof of concept

#### 2. Monorepo Structure
```
omnicare/
├── packages/
│   ├── core/          # Shared utilities
│   ├── fhirtypes/     # FHIR TypeScript types
│   ├── ui/            # Clinical components
│   ├── api-client/    # Unified API client
│   └── validators/    # Shared validation
├── apps/
│   ├── web/           # Frontend application
│   ├── api/           # Backend services
│   └── mobile/        # Future mobile app
└── tools/             # Build and dev tools
```

**Benefits**:
- Shared type definitions
- Consistent API contracts
- Easier refactoring
- Better code reuse

#### 3. Clinical Component Library
```typescript
// Proposed component structure
import { PatientHeader, VitalSigns, MedicationList } from '@omnicare/ui';

export function PatientDashboard({ patientId }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <PatientHeader patientId={patientId} />
      <VitalSigns patientId={patientId} offline={true} />
      <MedicationList patientId={patientId} editable={true} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Medium-Term Improvements (2-3 months)

#### 1. FHIR-First Data Modeling
- Migrate custom models to pure FHIR resources
- Implement FHIR profiles for customization
- Add comprehensive FHIR validation
- Create implementation guides

#### 2. Terminology Service Implementation
```typescript
// Proposed terminology service
class TerminologyService {
  async expandValueSet(valueSetUrl: string): Promise<ValueSet> {
    // Expand codes from ValueSet
  }
  
  async validateCode(system: string, code: string): Promise<boolean> {
    // Validate code against terminology
  }
  
  async translateCode(sourceSystem: string, targetSystem: string, code: string) {
    // Cross-system code translation
  }
}
```

### Long-Term Initiatives (3-6 months)

#### 1. Hybrid Deployment Architecture
```typescript
// Proposed agent architecture
class OmniCareAgent {
  async syncWithCloud() {
    // Bidirectional sync with cloud instance
  }
  
  async handleLocalRequests() {
    // Process requests locally when offline
  }
  
  async enforceDataResidency() {
    // Ensure compliance with data sovereignty
  }
}
```
