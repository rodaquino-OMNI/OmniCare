# HIPAA Compliance Operations Guide
## OmniCare EMR Production Deployment

### Overview
This document outlines the operational procedures and compliance measures implemented for the OmniCare EMR system to ensure HIPAA compliance in production environments.

### HIPAA Security Rule Implementation

#### 164.312(a) - Access Control
**Implementation:**
- Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced at Kubernetes and application levels
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for all administrative access
- Session timeout policies (30 minutes of inactivity)
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts

**Monitoring:**
- Real-time alerts for unauthorized access attempts
- Daily audit reports of user access patterns
- Quarterly access review and certification

**Operational Procedures:**
1. **User Onboarding:**
   ```bash
   # Create user with minimal privileges
   kubectl create serviceaccount <username> -n omnicare
   kubectl create rolebinding <username>-binding --clusterrole=<role> --serviceaccount=omnicare:<username>
   ```

2. **Access Review:**
   ```bash
   # Generate access report
   kubectl get rolebindings,clusterrolebindings -o yaml | grep -A 10 -B 5 omnicare
   ```

#### 164.312(b) - Audit Controls
**Implementation:**
- Comprehensive audit logging for all PHI access
- Immutable audit trail with cryptographic integrity
- Centralized log aggregation using ELK stack
- Real-time monitoring and alerting

**Log Retention:**
- Audit logs retained for 6 years minimum
- Encrypted storage with access controls
- Regular backup and disaster recovery testing

**Operational Procedures:**
1. **Daily Audit Review:**
   ```bash
   # Check audit log health
   kubectl logs -n omnicare deployment/backend | grep "audit" | tail -100
   
   # Verify log integrity
   kubectl exec -n omnicare deployment/elasticsearch -- curl -X GET "localhost:9200/audit-logs-*/_search?q=integrity_check:failed"
   ```

2. **Monthly Audit Report:**
   ```bash
   # Generate monthly access report
   kubectl exec -n omnicare deployment/elasticsearch -- curl -X GET "localhost:9200/audit-logs-*/_search" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"query":{"range":{"@timestamp":{"gte":"now-1M"}}},"aggs":{"phi_access":{"terms":{"field":"phi_access_type"}}}}'
   ```

#### 164.312(c) - Integrity
**Implementation:**
- Data integrity validation using checksums and digital signatures
- Database transaction logging and recovery
- Automated backup verification
- Version control for all system changes

**Operational Procedures:**
1. **Data Integrity Verification:**
   ```bash
   # Verify database integrity
   kubectl exec -n omnicare deployment/postgres -- pg_dump --schema-only omnicare_emr | sha256sum
   
   # Check for unauthorized modifications
   kubectl exec -n omnicare deployment/backend -- node scripts/integrity-check.js
   ```

2. **Backup Verification:**
   ```bash
   # Test backup restoration
   kubectl create job backup-test --from=cronjob/postgres-backup -n omnicare
   kubectl wait --for=condition=complete job/backup-test -n omnicare --timeout=600s
   ```

#### 164.312(d) - Person or Entity Authentication
**Implementation:**
- Strong password policies (minimum 12 characters, complexity requirements)
- Multi-factor authentication for all users
- Certificate-based authentication for system components
- Regular password rotation and account reviews

**Operational Procedures:**
1. **Password Policy Enforcement:**
   ```bash
   # Check password policy compliance
   kubectl exec -n omnicare deployment/backend -- node scripts/password-policy-check.js
   ```

2. **MFA Configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Verify MFA status for all users
   kubectl exec -n omnicare deployment/backend -- node scripts/mfa-status-check.js
   ```

#### 164.312(e) - Transmission Security
**Implementation:**
- TLS 1.3 encryption for all data in transit
- VPN for administrative access
- End-to-end encryption for PHI transmission
- Certificate management and rotation

**Operational Procedures:**
1. **TLS Certificate Management:**
   ```bash
   # Check certificate expiration
   kubectl get certificates -n omnicare
   
   # Verify TLS configuration
   openssl s_client -connect omnicare.example.com:443 -servername omnicare.example.com
   ```

2. **Encryption Verification:**
   ```bash
   # Test encryption endpoints
   curl -v -X GET https://api.omnicare.example.com/health 2>&1 | grep -E "(TLS|SSL)"
   ```

### Business Associate Agreements (BAA)

#### Cloud Provider BAA
- **AWS:** Signed BAA covering all AWS services used
- **Google Cloud:** BAA for backup and disaster recovery services
- **Certificate Authority:** BAA for SSL certificate management

#### Vendor Management

- Vendor security assessments
- Incident response coordination

### Incident Response Procedures

#### HIPAA Breach Response
1. **Immediate Response (0-60 minutes):**
   ```bash
   # Isolate affected systems
   kubectl scale deployment <affected-service> --replicas=0 -n omnicare
   
   # Capture forensic evidence
   kubectl logs deployment/<affected-service> -n omnicare > incident-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
   
   # Notify incident response team
   curl -X POST https://incident-api.omnicare.com/alert \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $INCIDENT_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"severity":"critical","type":"hipaa_breach","timestamp":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}'
   ```

2. **Investigation Phase (1-24 hours):**

   # Test backup restoration
   kubectl create job restore-test --from=cronjob/postgres-backup -n omnicare
   ```

2. **Application Backups:**
   ```bash
   # Backup application configuration
   kubectl get configmaps -n omnicare -o yaml > configmaps-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).yaml
