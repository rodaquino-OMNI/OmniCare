## Branch Creation Strategy

### Created Feature Branches

Based on the analysis, the following feature branches have been created:

1. **feature/clinical-core** - For clinical workflow development
2. **feature/administrative-workflows** - For administrative feature development
3. **feature/mobile-app** - For React Native mobile application
4. **feature/analytics-reporting** - For analytics and reporting systems
5. **feature/integration-apis** - For integration and API development
6. **feature/cds-system** - For clinical decision support features

### Branch Protection Rules

Each feature branch should implement the following protection rules:

```yaml
branch_protection:
  required_status_checks:
    strict: true
    contexts:
      - "ci/tests"
      - "ci/lint"
      - "ci/typecheck"
      - "ci/security-scan"
  enforce_admins: true
  required_pull_request_reviews:
    required_approving_review_count: 2
    dismiss_stale_reviews: true
    require_code_owner_reviews: true
  restrictions:
    teams: ["development-team", "senior-developers"]
```

## Development Workflow

### Feature Branch Development Process

1. **Branch Creation**: Create feature branch from latest main
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name
   ```

2. **Development**: Implement features following coding standards
   - Use TypeScript for type safety
   - Follow existing architectural patterns
   - Include comprehensive tests
   - Update documentation

3. **Code Review**: Submit pull requests with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Screenshots for UI changes
   - Test coverage reports
   - Performance impact analysis

4. **Integration Testing**: Run full test suite including:
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - E2E tests
   - Security scanning
   - HIPAA compliance checks

5. **Merge Strategy**: Use squash merges for feature branches
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge --squash feature/feature-name
   git commit -m "feat: implement feature-name with comprehensive tests"
   ```

### Cross-Team Coordination

#### Dependencies Between Features

- **Clinical Core** ↔ **CDS System**: Shared clinical data models
- **Administrative Workflows** ↔ **Integration APIs**: Patient data synchronization  
- **Mobile App** ↔ **Clinical Core**: Shared clinical components
- **Analytics** ↔ **All Features**: Data collection from all modules

#### Coordination Strategies

1. **Shared Interfaces**: Define TypeScript interfaces in shared packages
2. **API Contracts**: Use OpenAPI specifications for service contracts
3. **Regular Sync**: Weekly cross-team synchronization meetings
4. **Integration Testing**: Dedicated integration testing environment

## Conclusion

This branching strategy provides a structured approach to developing the OmniCare EMR system while enabling parallel development across multiple feature areas. The strategy balances development efficiency with code quality, ensuring that the complex healthcare system can be developed safely and efficiently by multiple teams.

The separation of major feature sets into dedicated branches allows for:
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple teams working simultaneously
- **Risk Isolation**: Feature development doesn't impact other areas
- **Quality Control**: Comprehensive testing and review processes
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Independent feature deployment capabilities

Regular review and adjustment of this strategy will ensure it continues to meet the project's evolving needs as development progresses through the five implementation phases.
