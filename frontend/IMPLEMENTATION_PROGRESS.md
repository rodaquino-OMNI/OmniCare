# OmniCare EMR Frontend Implementation Progress

## Project Setup - COMPLETED
- âœ… Next.js 14 with TypeScript 5.x initialized
- âœ… All dependencies installed: Medplum, Mantine 7+, React Query, Zustand, healthcare libs
- âœ… Project structure created with proper folder organization

## Design System - COMPLETED  
- âœ… Comprehensive color system with bright healthcare-focused palette
- âœ… Typography and spacing constants defined
- âœ… CSS variables and utility classes for medical contexts
- âœ… Mantine theme configuration with healthcare components
- âœ… Responsive design utilities and print styles
- âœ… Accessibility improvements (focus, contrast, reduced motion)

## State Management - COMPLETED
- âœ… Zustand stores created:
  - Authentication store with role-based permissions
  - Patient store with search, filtering, clinical data
  - UI store with preferences, notifications, modal management
- âœ… Utility functions for healthcare data processing
- âœ… Type definitions for all healthcare entities

## Authentication & Routing - COMPLETED
- âœ… Role-based authentication system
- âœ… Protected route components with permission checking
- âœ… Login form with demo accounts for different roles
- âœ… Main application layout with sidebar and header
- âœ… Navigation system with role-based menu filtering
- âœ… Dashboard with healthcare metrics and quick actions

## Components Implemented
- âœ… LoginForm - Complete authentication interface
- âœ… ProtectedRoute - Role-based access control wrapper
- âœ… Sidebar - Healthcare navigation with role filtering
- âœ… Header - Search, notifications, user menu
- âœ… AppLayout - Main application wrapper
- âœ… Dashboard - Healthcare metrics and activity overview

## Next Steps for Medplum Integration
- ðŸ”„ Integrate Medplum React components (120+ healthcare components)
- ðŸ”„ Patient Chart interface (Timeline, Summary, Header)
- ðŸ”„ Clinical Documentation with SmartText
- ðŸ”„ Order Management (CPOE) interface
- ðŸ”„ Results Management with visualization
- ðŸ”„ Medication Management with e-prescribing

## Technical Implementation Details
- Frontend stack: Next.js 14, TypeScript 5.x, Mantine 7+, Zustand, React Query
- Design: Bright modern healthcare UI with primary blue (#0091FF), secondary green (#00C853)
- Architecture: Component-based with role-based access control
- Responsive: Mobile-first design with breakpoint utilities
- Accessibility: WCAG compliant with focus management and screen reader support

## File Structure Created
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/ (Next.js 14 app router)
â”œâ”€â”€ components/ (auth, layout, ui, patient, clinical, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ stores/ (Zustand state management)
â”œâ”€â”€ types/ (TypeScript definitions)
â”œâ”€â”€ constants/ (theme, navigation, validation)
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/ (helper functions)
â””â”€â”€ lib/ (providers, configuration)
```

## Key Features Implemented
- Role-based authentication with 8 user types (physician, nurse, admin, etc.)
- Comprehensive healthcare-specific design system
- Patient management with search and filtering capabilities
- Clinical workflow support with proper permissions
- Modern responsive UI with accessibility features
- State management optimized for healthcare data
- Navigation system tailored to medical workflows

The foundation is complete and ready for Medplum integration and healthcare component development.
